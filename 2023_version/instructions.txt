The main macro to run is 20230821_batch_average_.ijm
upon start first it will ask for a folder with stored/saved macros.
The second dialog window will ask for the folder
with tif stacks, assuming they are all already reversed
in the same order.
(for that you can use Reverse_hyperstack_.ijm).
Then parameters window shows up, but I think for now
the values should be ok, no need to change.
Macro will run and save aligned stacks inside
a new "aligned" folder in tif files folder
and destretched stacks in "destretched" folder.
After that you need to rotate each them,
so the foot looks in the same direction.
After that you need to run plugin
ARegisterNDFFT->Iterative Averaging
with parameters:
Input images: Specify images in a folder
Initial template: Average(center)
# of iterations: 10 (or so)
Check "Exclude zero values?"
Maximum shift: 0.3
And the rest is unchecked.

In the end it should output the final averaged z-stack.
Let me know how it goes or if you have troubles/questions.
