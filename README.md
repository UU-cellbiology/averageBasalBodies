# averageBasalBodies

This repository contains a set of [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) macros   
for extraction, averaging and normalization (rescaling) of [basal bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_body)  
from [expansion microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_microscopy) volumetric datasets. 

The analysis workflow corresponds to the manuscript:  
**"Microtubule organization and molecular architecture of ciliary basal bodies in multiciliated airway cells"**   
van Grinsven et al., to be published.  

For the full documentation, please refer to the **[wiki](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/extractBasalBodies/wiki)**.
